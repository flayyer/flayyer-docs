GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way you want.

Write these two lines on your terminal to download from [https://github.com/flayyer/flayyer-actions][flayyer-actions] the latest version of the workflow file:

```bash title="Terminal.app"
mkdir -p .github/workflows
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flayyer/flayyer-actions/main/workflow-templates/flayyer-yarn.yml --output .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

:::note
Afraid of copy-pasting commands from strangers?
Grab this file [flayyer-yarn.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flayyer/flayyer-actions/main/workflow-templates/flayyer-yarn.yml) and put it in your project as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
